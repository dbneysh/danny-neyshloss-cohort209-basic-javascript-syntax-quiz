# 1. Name at least three of the primitive data types in Javascript.

primitive data type: data that is not an object and has no methods
6 primitive data types: strings, numbers, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol
string type: used to represent textual data; a set of elements of 16-bit unsigned integer values
numbers, bigint: the two built-in numeric types are Number and bigint
boolean: represents a logical entity and can have two values of true and false 
undefined: a variable that has not been assigned a values
symbol: a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property

# 2. Name one non-primitive data type.

mutable data types or objects: the value of an object can be changed after it gets created

# 3. What is the difference between a function parameter and a function argument?

Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition while the function arguments are the real values passed to the function; parameters are initialized to the values of the arguments supplied 

# 4. Write at least 3 of the comparison operators in Javascript.

===, >, <=

# 5. Name 3 keywords that can be used to declare a variable.

const
let
var 

# 6. Create an array called `myArray`.

const myArray = []; 

# 7. Create an object called `myObject`.

const myObject = {};

# 8. Write two functions: one using the `fat arrow` syntax and one using the `function` keyword syntax.

const func1 = () => {}; 
const func2 = function() {}

# 9. Write a function that returns the number 5.

const function = () => {
    return 5;
}

# 10. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns the sum of them.

const func = (num1, num2) => {
    return num1 + num2;
}

# 11. Write a function that takes an array and returns the first index of the array.

const func = (array) => {
    return array[0];

# 12. Write function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all of the numbers.

const func = (array) => {
    return array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)

# 13. Create an object with two properties and show two different ways to access them.

const myObject = {
    propertyOne: 1,
    propertyTwo: 2
}

myObject.propertyOne;
myObject.propertyTwo;

# 14. Create a function that takes two numbers and returns the number of times that the first number is divisible by the second number.

const func = (num1, num2) => {
    return Math.floor(num2 / num1);
}

# 15. List three array methods.

includes()
map()
reduce()
